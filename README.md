# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Food Delivery App

This was one of the most robust projects I had the opportunity to build so far. I used React with Tailwind framwork and it was quite a challeging experience. Firebase was the database we chose to use for this application and for this size and simulation app it works just fine. The project brings features I had never used and certainly contributed to my growth as a front end developer.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
